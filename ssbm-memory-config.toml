# This file is organized into 4 sections
# 	- structure:
# 		This outlines the primitive data structure of the data found in this
# 		config which is a memory address mapping to a structure containing the
# 		data label and the value( which implicitly holds type information ).
# 		However, block data has no value because it's only perpose it to point
# 		to other data.
# 	- addresses:
# 		These are addresses of values of the game that do not need to be
# 		computed using offsets.
# 	- blocks:
# 		Block data describes the start of data blocks.  data blocks contain
# 		memory locations that can be obtained by calculating the offset in the
# 		offset section.  Block section headers have the same correspoding name
# 		to their offsets making blocks and offsets indexable by each others
# 		header information.
# 	- offsets:
# 		Offsets are used to calculate the abosolute addresses given a block of
# 		data.  They typically represent attributes of a data structure similiar
# 		to a "C" data structure. Block section headers have the same correspoding name
# 		to their offsets making blocks and offsets indexable by each others
# 		header information.
